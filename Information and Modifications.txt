1.Here the http://localhost/User/CompanyProducts.php page has two columns to
  show the product detail to user i.e. just the description and the photo of 
  the products rather than the four columns specifying the file name and file
  size in the previous version. 

  This will give the user clear view of the details and the photo.

  the company's products

5.All main.css file reprogrammed in order to enlarge the width of the page
  and also clear demarkations have been made on the issues of security boundary
  between the manager and the administrator i.e. on the previous versions

  account access will revert the page to administrator access.

  hinder the page from being displayed on remote server
